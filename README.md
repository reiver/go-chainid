# go-chainid

Package **chainid** provides **Chain IDs** (i.e., **chain-id**s / **chain_id**s / **ChainID**s) (as per [ERC-155](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-155)), for the Go programming language.

The data for the **chain-id**s comes from https://chainid.network/

This package provides those **chain-id**s as **constants**, which are easily usable by programs written in the Go programming language.
